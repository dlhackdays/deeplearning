The sixth meeting was filled with a variety of activities:

* finishing the TensorFlow tutorials
* starting our own projects
* discussing reinforcement learning, RNNs, games and some papers informally
* discussing the next steps:
  We'll have **3 more sessions** (skipping Christmas), which will be used to:
    - look at some chapters of the Deep Learning book, especially RNNs and applications
    - discuss papers in the field
    - build! Using TensorFlow do build our own applications. Coming up with good
      projects is actually hard, but we're getting there.

It is hard to describe the experience of attending our session today.
Next time: Deep Learning book chapter 10 (RNNs), 3 paper presentations, and programming.
