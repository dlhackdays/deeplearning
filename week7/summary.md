Week 7, Sunday Decembre 11, 2016

This week was paper week. Unfortunately, two out of three paper presentations
(including mine) weren't ready yet, so we had a short paper session with long
discussion on RNNs and games afterwards.

Paul presented a paper (see slides) on genetic algorithms applied to neural
networks. The paper defines a genetic code that describes (simple) neural
networks, consisting of neurons, connections and weights. The networks are used
as defined by the genotype, thus not trained on runtime. The strongest networks
are selected and crossover + mutation happens to obtain the next generation.
The process seemed to make sense, but it wasn't clear what the results were,
and more importantly, how it would scale to networks of interesting sizes.

We then discussed recursive neural networks, a group of network topologies we
didn't discuss before, and how they might work. We'll look at them more closely
later in the series.
