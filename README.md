deeplearning
============
We're doing a biweekly study group about **Deep Learning** in Amsterdam: 1 evening (2-3h) every other week. It's for a group of people with strong CS + LA background, pref. some familiarity with machine learning and neural network basics.

## Resources
syllabus, proposal: practical approach, but with deep understanding (not just trying github repos): book Nielsen (ML -> DL), then a course (either Google, creative DL, or (outdated) coursera) with corresponding homeworks. Extra: papers (DL classics, microsoft ebook, IBM watson, DeepMind), practical DL projects (TensorFlow, Theano, Torch, Keras.io), deep dreaming, GPU programming
