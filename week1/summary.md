At Sunday September 18, we came together with a group of 10 people
for a Deep Learning Track kick-off.

After a short introduction round, we discussed practical matters in
setting up the group. We decided the following:

1. Biweekly get-together (Sundays at 13:00)
2. We aim for both theoretical background and practical experience:
   minimum technical depth required for understanding the principles,
   followed by practical exercises and projects to work on together.
3. Study material:
   - book (2016): Neural Nets & Deep Learning, by Michael Nielsen
     Gives an introduction into neural nets and deep learning extensions
     and focusses on both the concepts (incl. basic math) and practical
     stuff (developing pure python example code for image classification)
   - choose one of practical courses and get started with TensorFlow:
     - Deep Learning @ Udacity (2016), intro TensorFlow
     - Creative Applications w/ DL @ Kadenze (2016), intro TensorFlow
     - NN&DL by Hinton (2012), in MATLAB; slightly outdated
   - various other reads, like
     - Deep Learning Book (2016): http://www.deeplearningbook.org/
       useful for reference materials
     - famous papers, like DeepMind (Atari, AlphaGo, WaveNet), Watson,
       and other breakthrough papers

The rest of the day was spent talking, working through chapter 1, watching
an introduction talk (https://vimeo.com/170189199), and drinking cocktails.
